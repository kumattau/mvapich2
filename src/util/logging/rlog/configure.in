AC_INIT(rlog.c)

dnl The MVAPICH2 top-level configure adds a bunch of flags to the
dnl user-defined CFLAGS by processing different configure command-line
dnl arguments (--enable-g, --enable-default-optimization). These updated
dnl flags are passed down as a separate flag. Here, we don't care about
dnl the user-defined flags, but rather this updated flags, so we just
dnl overwrite CFLAGS with them.

dnl directory paths for the files that you need.  Allow an environment
dnl variable to provide the values, so that if they are in a strange
dnl place, the user can set the environment variable and configure will
dnl use that value (it should still check that the value is valid, i.e.,
dnl the necessary files are in the specified directory)
