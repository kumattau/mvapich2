/*
 * In addition to the discussion in the paper "A Standard Interface for Debugger 
 * Access to Message Queue Inforation in MPI" and the more recent paper "An 
 * Interface to Support the Identification of Dynamic {MPI} 2 Processes for 
 * Scalable Parallel Debugging", there are a few features that have become
 * defacto standard.  These include the "proctable" (a relic of the way 
 * that p4 represented processes that was used in the ch_p4 device in 
 * MPICH1), a debugger state (has MPI started or exited), and a routine that
 * has the sole purpose of serving as a break point for a debugger.
 * Specifically, these extensions are:
 *
 *  void * MPIR_Breakpoint( void )
 *
 * This routine should be called at any point where control should be
 * offered to the debugger.  Typical spots are in MPI_Init/MPI_Init_thread
 * after initialization is completed and in MPI_Abort before exiting.
 *
 * MPIR_DebuggerSetAborting( const char *msg )
 *
 * This routine should be called when MPI is exiting (either in finalize
 * or abort.  If a message is provided, it will call MPIR_Breakpoint.
 * This routine sets the variables MPIR_debug_state and MPIR_debug_abort_string.
 *
 * In MPICH1, the variables MPIR_debug_state, MPIR_debug_abort_string, 
 * MPIR_being_debugged, and MPIR_debug_gate where exported globally.  
 * In MPICH2, while these are global variables (so that the debugger can
 * find them easily), they are not explicitly exported or referenced outside
 * of a few routines.  In particular, MPID_Abort uses MPIR_DebuggerSetAborting
 * instead of directly accessing these variables.
