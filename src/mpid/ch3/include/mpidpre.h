/* For the typical communication system for which the ch3 channel is
   appropriate, 16 bits is sufficient for the rank.  By also using 16
   bits for the context, we can reduce the size of the match
   information, which is beneficial for slower communication
   links. Further, this allows the total structure size to be 64 bits
   and the search operations can be optimized on 64-bit platforms. We
   use a union of the actual required structure with a MPIR_Upint, so
   in this optimized case, the "whole" field can be used for
   comparisons.

   Note that the MPICH2 code (in src/mpi) uses int for rank (and usually for 
   contextids, though some work is needed there).  

   Note:  We need to check for truncation of rank in MPID_Init - it should 
   confirm that the size of comm_world is less than 2^15, and in an communicator
   create (that may make use of dynamically created processes) that the
   size of the communicator is within range.

   If any part of the definition of this type is changed, those changes
   must be reflected in the debugger interface in src/mpi/debugger/dll_mpich2.c
   and dbgstub.c

 *
 * MPIDI_CH3_CA_UNPACK_UEBUF_AND_COMPLETE - This is a special case of the 
 * MPIDI_CH3_CA_COMPLETE.  The data for an unexpected
 * eager messaage has been stored into a temporary buffer and needs to be 
 * copied/unpacked into the user buffer before the

 * MPIDI_CH3_CA_COMPLETE.  The data from the completing
 * read has been stored into a temporary send/receive buffer and needs to be 
 * copied/unpacked into the user buffer before the
 * completion counter can be decremented, etc.
 *
 * MPIDI_CH3_CA_RELOAD_IOV - This request contains more segments of data than 
 * the IOV or buffer space allow.  Since the
 * previously request operation has completed, the IOV in the request should 
 * be reload at this time.
 *
 * MPIDI_CH3_CA_UNPACK_SRBUF_AND_RELOAD_IOV - This is a special case of the 
 * MPIDI_CH3_CA_RELOAD_IOV.  The data from the
 * completing read operation has been stored into a temporary send/receive 
 * buffer and needs to be copied/unpacked into the user
 * buffer before the IOV is reloaded.
 *
 * MPIDI_CH3_CA_END_CH3 - This not a real action, but rather a marker.  
 * All actions numerically less than MPID_CA_END are defined
 * by channel device.  Any actions numerically greater than MPIDI_CA_END are 
 * internal to the channel instance and must be handled
 * by the channel instance.
