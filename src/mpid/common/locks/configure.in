AC_INIT(configure.in)

dnl The MPICH2 top-level configure adds a bunch of flags to the
dnl user-defined CFLAGS by processing different configure command-line
dnl arguments (--enable-g, --enable-default-optimization). These updated
dnl flags are passed down as a separate flag. Here, we don't care about
dnl the user-defined flags, but rather this updated flags, so we just
dnl overwrite CFLAGS with them.
