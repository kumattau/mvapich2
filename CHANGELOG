------------------
This file briefly describes the latest changes to the MVAPICH2 software
package.  The logs are arranged in the "most recent first" order.

10/18/2007
* Enhance udapl initializaton, set all ep_attr fields properly.
  Thanks for Kanoj Sarcar from NetXen for the patch.

10/10/2007

   variable usage in DEBUG_PRINT in rdma-cm.c
   Thanks to Steve Wise for reporting these.

07/25/2007 (Release data of MVAPICH2-1.0-beta)

* Following features are added in this new MVAPICH2-1.0-beta release:

- Message coalescing support to enable reduction of per Queue-pair
  send queues for reduction in memory requirement on large scale
  clusters. This design also increases the small message messaging
  rate significantly. Available for Open Fabrics Gen2-IB.

- Hot-Spot Avoidance Mechanism (HSAM) for alleviating
  network congestion in large scale clusters. Available for
  Open Fabrics Gen2-IB.

- RDMA CM based on-demand connection management for large scale
  clusters. Available for OpenFabrics Gen2-IB and Gen2-iWARP.

- uDAPL on-demand connection management for large scale clusters.
  Available for uDAPL interface (including Solaris IB implementation).

- RDMA Read support for increased overlap of computation and
  communication. Available for OpenFabrics Gen2-IB and Gen2-iWARP.

- Application-initiated system-level (synchronous) checkpointing in
  addition to the user-transparent checkpointing. User application can
  now request a whole program checkpoint synchronously with BLCR by
  calling special functions within the application. Available for
  OpenFabrics Gen2-IB.

- Network-Level fault tolerance with Automatic Path Migration (APM)
  for tolerating intermittent network failures over InfiniBand.
  Available for OpenFabrics Gen2-IB.

- Integrated multi-rail communication support for OpenFabrics
  Gen2-iWARP.

- Blocking mode of communication progress. Available for OpenFabrics
  Gen2-IB.

- Based on MPICH2 1.0.5p4.
