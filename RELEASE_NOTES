                        KNOWN ISSUES
----------------------------------------------------------------------

### ABI issues

 * The format of MPI_INFO_ENV was changed between v3.0 and v3.0.1 in
   an ABI incompatible way.  The change was not caught, unfortunately,
   and the ABI string not updated appropriately.

   http://trac.mpich.org/projects/mpich/ticket/1719


### Large counts

 * The new MPI-3 "large count" routines (e.g., MPI_Type_size_x) do not
   work correctly due to 64-bit to 32-bit truncations occurring inside
   the MPICH library.  We expect to fix this in upcoming releases.


### Fine-grained thread safety

 * ch3:sock does not (and will not) support fine-grained threading.

 * MPI-IO APIs are not currently thread-safe when using fine-grained
   threading (--enable-thread-cs=per-object).

 * ch3:nemesis:tcp fine-grained threading is still experimental and may
   have correctness or performance issues.  Known correctness issues
   include dynamic process support and generalized request support.


### Lacking channel-specific features

 * ch3 does not presently support communication across heterogeneous
   platforms (e.g., a big-endian machine communicating with a
   little-endian machine).

 * ch3:nemesis:mx does not support dynamic processes at this time.

 * Support for "external32" data representation is incomplete. This
   affects the MPI_Pack_external and MPI_Unpack_external routines, as
   well the external data representation capabilities of ROMIO.  In
   particular: noncontiguous user buffers could consume egregious
   amounts of memory in the MPI library and any types which vary in
   width between the native representation and the external32
   representation will likely cause corruption.  The following ticket
   contains some additional information:

     http://trac.mpich.org/projects/mpich/ticket/1754

 * ch3 has known problems in some cases when threading and dynamic
   processes are used together on communicators of size greater than
   one.


### Build Platforms

 * Build fails with Intel compiler suite 13.0, because of weak symbol
   issues in the compiler.  A workaround is to disable weak symbol
   support by passing --disable-weak-symbols to configure.  See the
   following ticket for more information:

     https://trac.mpich.org/projects/mpich/ticket/1659


### Process Managers

 * Hydra has a bug related to stdin handling:

     https://trac.mpich.org/projects/mpich/ticket/1782


### Performance issues

 * SMP-aware collectives do not perform as well, in select cases, as
   non-SMP-aware collectives, e.g. MPI_Reduce with message sizes
   larger than 64KiB. These can be disabled by the configure option
   "--disable-smpcoll".

 * MPI_Irecv operations that are not explicitly completed before
   MPI_Finalize is called may fail to complete before MPI_Finalize
   returns, and thus never complete. Furthermore, any matching send
   operations may erroneously fail. By explicitly completed, we mean
   that the request associated with the operation is completed by one
   of the MPI_Test or MPI_Wait routines.
