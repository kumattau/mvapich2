OSU Micro Benchmarks v3.4 (09/12/11)
* New Features & Enhancments
    - Update one-sided communication benchmarks to provide shared memory hint
      in MPI_Alloc_mem calls
    - Add passive one-sided communication benchmarks
    - Give default values to configure definitions (can now build directly with
      mpicc)
    - Update latency benchmarks to begin from 0 byte message
    - Update one-sided communication benchmarks to use MPI_Alloc_mem for buffer
      allocation
* Bug Fixes
    - Remove memory leaks in one-sided communication benchmarks
    - Update benchmarks to touch buffers before using them for communication
    - Fix osu_get_bw test to use different buffers for concurrent communication
      operations
    - Fix several compilation warnings
