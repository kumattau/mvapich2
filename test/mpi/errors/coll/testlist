# MPICH2 currently fails the bcastlength test because it needs to do more
# checking on the receive status, so for the 1.0.5 release, we are 
# commenting out this test.
# 3/20/2011.  Since this was commented out before 1.0.5 and we are now 
# at 1.4, it is clear that this should not be commented out again
