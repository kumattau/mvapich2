This directory contains programs and tests that need to be run by
a human being rather than a script.  Instructions on running each test
are in the test file at the top.

singjoin - A test of Comm_join, including a test of comm_join by singleton
           processes

testconnect - A test of Comm_connect and Comm_accept, with many processes.
              Use the script manyconnect to run them, as in

make testconnect
./manyconnect
