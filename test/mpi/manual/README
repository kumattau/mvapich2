This directory contains programs and tests that need to be run by
a human being rather than a script.  Instructions on running each test
are in the test file at the top.

singjoin - A test of Comm_join, including a test of comm_join by singleton
           processes

testconnect - A test of Comm_connect and Comm_accept, with many processes.
              Use the script manyconnect to run them, as in

make testconnect
./manyconnect

dimsbalanced - A test of MPI_Dims_create; this checks that Dims_create 
               produces well-balanced results.  Since there are no 
               requirements on the "balance" of the output of Dims_create,
               this is a test of the quality of implementation of the
               default MPI_Dims_create when there is no underlying 
               network topology.
