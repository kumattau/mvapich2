/*N fortran
Notes for Fortran:
All MPI routines in Fortran (except for 'MPI_WTIME' and 'MPI_WTICK') have 
an additional argument 'ierr' at the end of the argument list.  'ierr'
is an integer and has the same meaning as the return value of the routine 
in C.  In Fortran, MPI routines are subroutines, and are invoked with the 
'call' statement.  

All MPI objects (e.g., 'MPI_Datatype', 'MPI_Comm') are of type 'INTEGER'
in Fortran.

# - This should always be used with .N Fortran
/*N FortranStatus

The 'status' variable must be defined as an array of integer with size
'MPI_STATUS_SIZE'.  
N*/

/*N FortranString

 The sizes of MPI strings in Fortran are one less than the sizes of that 
 string in C/C++ because the C/C++ versions provide room for the trailing
 null character required by C/C++.  For example, 'MPI_MAX_ERROR_STRING' is 
 'mpif.h' is one smaller than the same value in 'mpi.h'.  See the MPI-2 
 standard, sections 2.6.2 and 4.12.9.

/*N collops
Notes on collective operations:

The reduction functions ('MPI_Op') do not return an error value.  As a result,
if the functions detect an error, all they can do is either call 'MPI_Abort'
or silently skip the problem.  Thus, if you change the error handler from
'MPI_ERRORS_ARE_FATAL' to something else, for example, 'MPI_ERRORS_RETURN', 
then no error may be indicated.

The reason for this is the performance problems in ensuring that 
all collective routines return the same error value.

/*N MPI2
 Note on standard:
 This function is part of the MPI-2 draft, and may change while the draft
 undergoes revision.  It is provided as an aid to programmers who wish
 to experiment with some MPI2 features.
N*/

/*N waitstatus
 Note on status for send operations:
 For send operations, the only use of status is for MPI_Test_cancelled or
 in the case that there is an error, in which case the MPI_ERROR field of
 status will be set.
